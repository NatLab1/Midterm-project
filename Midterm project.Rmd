#Import dataset
```{r}
exercise_data = read_csv(file = "./data/p8105_mtp_data.csv") 

#Notes - dataset observations:
#47 weeks in the study, days of week organized alphabetically.
#1440 "activity" columns, because there are 1440 min/day. 
#these are the activity "epochs", the signals measured per minute

#Don't include more than 5 figures. 3 is probably optimal.
